## Very new `sjPlot` package can show odds ratios

#### [`tab_model()`](https://strengejacke.github.io/sjPlot/articles/tab_model_estimates.html) can create very nice tables with OR (95% CI)

```{r}
#tab_model(m1, m2, m3, show.p = FALSE)
```

## Reproducibility - Local vs Global

- **Local** 

    + Can you reproduce the results on the same machine?
    
    + Can someone else reproduce the results on the same machine?
  
- **Global**

    + Can you reproduce the results on a different machine?
    
    + Can someone else reproduce the results on a different machine?

```


- Use a project oriented workflow

  + Data gathering
  
  + Data analysis
  
  + Results presentation

- Use Project in R Studio!

- Make your data and code publicly available

> "Reproducible research can still be wrong" (Leek & Peng, 2015)

- Work with a diverse team

- Learn from experts
